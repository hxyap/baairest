toy project for testing getting API embeddings thru http request

More or less this is just a for fun project to test whether I can provide embeddings by REST API w/ FastAPI + Gunicorn. My next steps:
- Dockerize this
- Use TorchServe https://pytorch.org/serve/ instead since that's probably more optimized for my usecase?
